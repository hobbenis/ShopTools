A desktop application to interact with an online commerce platform API.

It's currently a work in progress and being ported from Winforms.

The aim is to provide reporting and interfaces not available or not detailed enough on the platform's site.

Of course, I am not affiliated with any platform referenced in this project. Any use of a platform name in code is merely to label the API to be accessed.
