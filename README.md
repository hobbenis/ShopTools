A desktop application to interact with an online commerce platform API.

It's currently a work in progress and being ported from Winforms.

The aim is to provide reporting and interfaces not available or not detailed enough on the platform's site.

Currently it can: go through the OAuth process, store the key/tokens encrypted on disk, cache/view basic info on all available listings, view outstanding orders and provide a production summary report up to a specified date.

Of course, I am not affiliated with any platform referenced in this project. Any use of a platform name in code is merely to label the API to be accessed.
